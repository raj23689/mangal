## About

‚ú® __Mangal__ is a fancy CLI app written in Go which scrapes, downloads and packs manga into pdfs

‚öôÔ∏è The most important feature of Mangal is that it supports user defined scrapers
that can be added with just a few lines of config file (see [config](#config) & [limitations](#limitations))

ü¶é Works in both modes - TUI & Inline. Use it as a standalone app or integrate with scripts


üçø This app is inspired by __awesome__ [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli). Check it out!

## Examples

### TUI usage example

### Inline mode usage example

> For more information about inline mode type `mangal inline --help`

```bash
# Search manga. Returns a list of found manga
mangal inline --query "death note"

# Search manga. Returns a JSON list of found manga
mangal inline --query "death note" --json

# Get chapters of first manga in the list
mangal inline --query "death note" --manga 1

# Download first chapter of the first manga in the list
mangal inline --query "death note" --manga 1 --chapter 1
```

## Config

> TLDR: Use `mangal config where` to show where config should be located
> and `mangal config init` to create default config

Config is located at the OS default config directory.

- __Unix__ - `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mangal/config.toml` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` exists, else `$HOME/.config/mangal/config.toml`
- __Darwin__ (macOS) - `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/mangal/config.toml`
- __Windows__ - `%AppData%\mangal\config.toml`

You can load config from custom path by using `--config` flag

`mangal --config /user/configs/config.toml`

By default, Mangal uses [manganelo](https://ww5.manganelo.tv) as a source

```toml
# Which sources to use. You can use several sources, it won't affect perfomance'
use = ['manganelo']

# If false, then OS default pdf reader will be used
use_custom_pdf_reader = false
custom_pdf_reader = "zathura"

# Custom download path, can be either relative (to the pwd) or absolute
download_path = '.'

# Fullscreen mode
fullscreen = true

# Input prompt icon
prompt = "üîç"

# Input placeholder
placeholder = "What shall we look for?"

# Selected chapter mark
mark = "‚ñº"

# Search window title
title = "Mangal"

[sources]
    [sources.manganelo]
    # Base url
    base = 'https://ww5.manganelo.tv'

    # Search endpoint. Put %s where the query should be
    search = 'https://ww5.manganelo.tv/search/%s'

    # Selector of entry anchor (<a></a>) on search page
    manga_anchor = '.search-story-item a.item-title'

    # Selector of entry title on search page
    manga_title = '.search-story-item a.item-title'

    # Manga chapters anchors selector
    chapter_anchor = 'li.a-h a.chapter-name'

    # Manga chapters titles selector
    chapter_title = 'li.a-h a.chapter-name'

    # Reader page images selector
    reader_page = '.container-chapter-reader img'
    
    # Random delay between requests
    random_delay_ms = 500 # ms
    
    # Are chapters listed in reversed order on that source?
    # reversed order -> from newest chapter to oldest
    reversed_chapters_order = true
```

```

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metafates/mangal.git
cd mangal
go build
```

## Limitations

Even though many manga sites will work,
there exists some (serious) limitations to which sites could be added

- Navigation layout should follow this model
    - Each manga have a separate page
    - Manga page should have a some form of chapters list (not lazy loaded)
    - Each chapter should have a separate reader page with all images


Some sites that work well

- https://manganato.com
- https://ww3.mangakakalot.tv
- https://ww5.manganelo.tv


I'm planning to make a more advanced scraper creation system
to overcome this roadblocks somewhere in the future
